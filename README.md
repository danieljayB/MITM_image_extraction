MITM_image_extraction
=====================

Bash script implementing a MITM attack with Ettercap & image extraction from intercepted packets with Driftnet. 
Port forwarding setup within script. 

Only tested on the Raspberry Pi "Rasbian" image. Due to the nature of this program continously writing new images, I have formatted the code to write to an external HDD connected to the RPi. 

dependencies : ettercap & driftnet. Stricly intended for personal research.
